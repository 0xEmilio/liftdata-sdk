# LiftData-SDK
 Simple SDK for LifeData (https://www.liftdata.ai/)

This SDK wraps the OpenAPI Spec published here: https://processing.dev-studio.liftdata.ai/openapi.json

More info on how to call these and what values to expect: https://processing.dev-studio.liftdata.ai/docs#/

Eventually I'll build this out more with inputs and all that..


# Example
There is an `examples` folder, but to get this started, just import and call:

`const api = createLiftSDK(apiKey);`
